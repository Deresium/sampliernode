 <p>\r\n            Lotfi nait il y a 19 ans dans la capitale algérienne.\r\n            Enfant déjà, il s’intéresse beaucoup à la musique et au monde qui l’entoure.\r\n            Lotfi nous confie qu’il est très curieux depuis tout petit, qu’il adore se cultiver,\r\n            débattre et apprendre des autres et faire de nouvelles expériences. Baigné dans l’univers des mangas et des animés comme Naruto,\r\n            ces univers colorés vont beaucoup inspirer ses écrits, qui partagent une énergie forte et une envie de se dépasser,\r\n            créant un véritable parallèle entre la musique de Lotfi et les héros de ses animés préférés.\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <h2>Parcours</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Lotfi commence à écrire vers ses 15 ans, en coïncidence avec son arrivée en France.\r\n            Ses 4 années de maniement de la plume n’auront pas été de tout repos : 4000 abonnés Instagram,\r\n            un passage sur une radio locale nantaise, quelques scènes, notamment pour la fête de la musique,\r\n            Lotfi a déjà pas mal d’expérience dans le rap malgré son jeune âge.\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <h2>Inspirations</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Avec ses nombreux freestyles, l'électron libre Hayce Lemsi aura été une énorme influence pour Lotfi et ça se répercute sur sa musique.\r\n            C'est devant ses cercles d'amis qu'il commence ses premiers freestyles, que ce soit en cours de recrée ou encore au terrain de foot,\r\n            Lotfi est déchainé. Après avoir emmagasiné un maximum de confiance dû aux compliments de ses proches, il décide de franchir le pas ;\r\n            mettre une caméra devant lui et lâcher son premier freestyle sur Instagram.\r\n            Le principe lui plait et avec déjà plusieurs expériences à son actif que ce soit sur petite scène ou à la radio de sa région,\r\n            il sait que c'est ça qu'il veut faire, écrire et transmettre un message, un message qui lui est si cher, montrer qui est le vrai Lotfi,\r\n            et prouver qu’en se dépassant et en travaillant dur, on peut accomplir de grandes choses.\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <h2>Ambitions</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n            À l'heure actuelle il est conscient de son talent mais est assez mature pour dire qu'il est toujours dans l'ombre\r\n            et que son art n'a pas encore su être éclairé. Toutefois, son ambition reste la même et la patience est son maître mot,\r\n            car il sait que son travail va payer. Lotfi se voit d'ici quelques années arborer les scènes de sa région, son pays d'origine ou de cœur\r\n            pour faire passer ce message.\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Lotfi L’algérois c’est une efficacité remarquable, une exécution propre, une ambition noble et un projet intéressant.\r\n            Son parcours est déjà très impressionnant, on se doute qu’avec un tel talent à 19 ans,\r\n            Lotfi a toutes les cartes en mains pour devenir un membre important du rap game dans les prochaines années.

Comme par exemple : « j’ai bu la seine et tous ses\r\n            cadavres »\r\n            qui fait référence de notre point de vue au massacre du 17 octobre 1961 où la police française jetait des\r\n            corps de\r\n            manifestant Algérien dans le court d’eau qui traverse Paris. Cette spécialité de Booba de dire des choses en\r\n            laissant place à l’interprétation de l’auditeur apparait dans la majeure partie de ses sons, y compris dans\r\n            son\r\n            dernier album. Lors du son RST on retrouve la phrase « un roi sans couronne c’est mieux qu’un roi sans tête\r\n            ».\r\n            Booba ne cesse de dire dans chacune de ses interviews qu’il se considère comme le peuple (qu’il est le\r\n            peuple). A\r\n            notre égard cette phrase laisse interpréter que si en 1789 lors de la révolution française le roi avait plus\r\n            écouté les siens il ne se serait pas fait couper la tête mais au pire se serait vu se faire destituer sa\r\n            couronne.\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <h2>Chercheur d’Or Nwar :</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Ce n’est plus à prouver Booba sait miser sur le bon cheval, Kaaris, Damso et j’en passe sont des diamants\r\n            qui ont été taillé par le Duc.\r\n            Booba a toujours gardé cette « ligne de conduite » de faire découvrir au monde des jeunes rappeurs qu’il\r\n            considérait comme des pépites. Lors de son dernier opus, beaucoup auraient pu croire que Booba se serait\r\n            contenté de partir simplement mais là encore il nous a surpris en réalisant 7 feats avec des artistes comme\r\n            Jsx, Dala et Elia qui sont pour notre part de très bonnes découvertes.\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <h2>Sérénité :</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Lors de ce dernier album, on a eu affaire à un Booba assagi, apaisé à qui lui semble bien derrière lui\r\n            toutes ces histoires de clashs, d’ailleurs booba le laisse entendre dans une de ses dernières interviews\r\n            lorsqu’il dit qu’il est heureux de voir comment Damso est devenu mais que c’est dommage la façon dont ça\r\n            s’est fini. Lors du son éponyme de son album ultra à l’aide de cette phrase il nous fait bien comprendre\r\n            qu’il décide de se retirer de tout ça en citant « J’vais arrêter de parler d’eux, ils sont en dessous, ils\r\n            vont dire qu’c’est moi le haineux »\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <h2>Conclusion :</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Après 26 ans de carrière, il est indéniable que B2O aura marqué son ère ainsi que l’histoire du rap. Avec au\r\n            total 10 albums individuels sorti plus les projets avec son groupe Lunatic avant de se lancer en solo. Nous\r\n            retiendrons surtout de B20 que dès son deuxième album, il avait l’ambition que ses textes soient au\r\n            panthéon, résultat presque 20 ans plus tard la moitié de ses textes sont étudiés dans de grandes universités\r\n            littéraires.

Depuis 2015 et leur départ en indé, ils ne sont passés par aucun stade, grâce\r\n            au titre « j’fais mes affaires » ils sont passés de très peu connu à représentant du 77.

Ils répondent simplement, sourire aux lèvres : « pourquoi faire des feats ? On est\r\n            déjà nos propre feat ».

Une véritable alliance qui permet aux\r\n            différents artistes qui passent les portes d’Iceberg d’avoir tout à leur disposition, et de se concentrer\r\n            uniquement sur l’aspect artistique et non technique des leurs projets. Une initiative vivement appréciée\r\n            dans une industrie de plus en plus fermée et égoïste.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Un point commun réunit tous les fondateurs d’Iceberg Rap, ce point commun c’est cette envie d’entreprendre,\r\n            pour créer quelque chose qu’il leur est propre. Après diverse tentative, la meilleure des solutions s’est\r\n            ouverte à eux, comme la devise nationale belge le dit : l’union fait la force et c’est clairement ce que\r\n            nous laisse transparaitre le collectif d’iceberg rap.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Le projet naquit des mains d’Eliott qui dans un premier temps refusa toute aide même celle de Thomas dans un\r\n            premier temps mais après quelques semaines de réflexion, il décida de le recontacter.

Toutefois ce n’est pas pour autant que 100% de ses freestyles se concentrent\r\n            essentiellement sur un passage de Message.
